# Movies-ETL

## Purpose
- Build ETL pipelines from raw data to SQL databases.
- Extract data from different sources using Python.
- Use pandas to clean and transform data.
- Use regular expressions (regex) to parse data and convert text to numbers.
- Load data with PostgreSQL and verify in PgAdmin.

The project involved taking a large dataset from Kaggle and then transforming the data into a usable dataset for a "hack competition". After the data was transformed and constrained for the hackathon, the DataFrames were loaded into PostgresSQL.
